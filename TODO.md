# Link Tracker Implementation TODO

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- [x] Create TODO.md file
- [x] Create TypeScript interfaces and types
- [x] Set up in-memory data storage utilities
- [x] Create app layout with navigation
- [x] Set up validation schemas with Zod

## Phase 2: API Endpoints
- [x] Create links API endpoint (POST/GET)
- [x] Create individual link API endpoint
- [x] Create tracking endpoint with location capture
- [x] Create dashboard stats API endpoint
- [x] Create simple redirect handler (/t/[shortCode])

## Phase 3: Frontend Components
- [x] Create landing page with link creation form
- [x] Build dashboard page for links overview
- [x] Create detailed analytics page
- [x] Create analytics overview page

## Phase 4: Analytics & Features
- [x] Implement in-memory data storage
- [x] Add location detection with IP-based geolocation
- [x] Create stats overview components
- [x] Add copy-to-clipboard functionality

## Phase 5: Testing & Polish
- [x] Install dependencies (date-fns)
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) → AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing
- [ ] Build application
- [ ] Test API endpoints with curl
- [ ] Verify location tracking functionality
- [ ] Test link creation and redirection
- [ ] Final UI/UX polish

## Notes
- Using Next.js 15 with App Router
- In-memory storage for demo (easily upgradeable)
- IP-based location detection with ipapi.co
- Privacy-focused minimal data collection

## Current Status: ✅ READY FOR BUILD AND TESTING
All core components and API endpoints have been implemented. Ready to build and test the application.
